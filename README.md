# recogito

A Web-based tool for validating &amp; correcting geo-resolution results.

[TODO: how to use]

## Importing Data

The recogito database will be empty when you first start it. Data is imported in two steps:

* __Document metadata__ is imported as a JSON file. The JSON file can include metadata for
  multiple documents.
  
* __Annotations__ are imported as CSV files. A CSV file does not need to contain all annotations
  for a specific document (i.e. there can be multiple CSV files for one document). However, each
  CVS file must belong to exactly one document (i.e. there can't be annotations for different documents
  in one CSV file.)
