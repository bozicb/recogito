The Text: 8b. The surroundings of Jerusalem - Bethlehem and Hebron

From Jerusalem going to Bethlehem (Beit Lahm) - miles vi.
On the road, on the right hand, is a tomb, in which lies Rachel, the wife of Jacob [pct.28] ( Gen 35:16-20; Matt 2:16-18). Two miles from thence, on the left hand, is Bethlehem, where our Lord Jesus Christ was born ( Matt 2:18-25; Luke 2:1-7). A basilica has been built there by the orders of Constantine [pct.22, 29]. Not far from thence is the tomb of Ezekiel, Asaph, Job, Jesse, David, and Solomon, whose names are inscribed in Hebrew letters upon the wall as you go down into the vault itself.

[599] From thence to Bethasora (Bethzur, Beit Sur) - miles xiv.

There is the fountain in which Philip baptized the eunuch (Acts 8:26-40).
